## Disclaimer

When running the watch or the production build you can find there is a error:
 - No value exists in scope for the shorthand property 'route'. Either declare one or provide an initializer.

This is a bug that I can't find for now but I'll patch it as soon as possible, in the meantime the project works without any issue.
